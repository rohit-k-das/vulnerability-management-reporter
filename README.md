Vulnerability Management Report Generator
-----------------------------------------
The script uses a combination of `Device42, Nessus Security Center, Tenable, Google Sheet & Google Drive` to generate vulnerability report in the shared team drive as google sheets

Since the infrastructure in each company is different, you can use this script as a base to define your vulnerability reports. The reports generated by Tenable and Nessus Security Center is too big and has too much useless information for patching. The script attempts to cut down on the report as much as possible.

The script generates a vulnerability report seen in the last 15 days, divided based on criticality across environments. This takes into calculation the CVE score and host risk.

It uses Device42 to get the OS information and zone information. Nessus Security Center doesn't give the OS information from their API.

Recommended: Define the host risk per your environment in security center and tenable. Define the security zones for your IPs as well.

Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.lock`

Run the command: 
`python -B main.py`
